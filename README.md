## Data Engineering
I created a database on postgresql to organize and research employees at Pewlett Hackard from the 80s and 90s. Originally stored in CSV files, I took the employee information to make a comprehensive database from scratch.

## Data Analysis

With a built employee database, I then run SQL queries to gather information on the given data. I queried data to find all information on employees, then by department, or employees hired in 1986 or people strictly in Sales. The database allowed seemless SQL queries to answer basic research questions on all employees at Pewlett Hackard.
